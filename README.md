Vegas Wordle
------------

a hastily-constructed [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) with automatic random guesses

inspired by a friend talking about a wordle slot machine, plus https://dontwordle.com/

to-do:

* double-letter hints are buggy
* "empty guess list" errors while generating games
* animate the latest guess like a slot machine
* smaller dictionary file

wordle is not mine, please don't sue
